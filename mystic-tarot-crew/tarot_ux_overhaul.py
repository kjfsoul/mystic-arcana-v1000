    # 1. UIEnchanter - Fix premature reading display and card interaction flow
    card_interaction_task = create_base_task(
        description="""
        Fix the tarot card interaction flow to prevent premature reading display.
        CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:
        1. Readings are showing before cards are flipped - this breaks the mystical experience
        2. Card clicks should reveal individual cards sequentially, not all at once
        3. For 3-card spreads: Past card reveals first reading section, Present reveals second, Future reveals third
        4. Cards should appear face-down initially and flip with animation when clicked
        5. "Draw 3 Cards" and "Shuffle Deck" should be mutually exclusive actions
        
        Analyze the current UnifiedTarotPanelV2.tsx component and provide specific code fixes.
        Focus on state management and conditional rendering logic.

    shuffle_animation_task = create_base_task(
        description="""
        Implement proper card shuffling animation and audio feedback.
        REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Visual shuffling animation showing cards mixing/blending
        2. Authentic card shuffling sound effect (multiple card flips/rustling)
        3. Animation duration should feel realistic (2-3 seconds)
        4. Disable other interactions during shuffling
        5. Show loading state or shuffling indicator
        6. Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
        
        Provide specific implementation for the shuffle button click handler.

    # 3. CardWeaver - Implement card reversal logic
    reversal_logic_task = create_base_task(
        description="""
        Implement missing tarot card reversal logic and visual indicators.
        REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Random reversal assignment during card draw (traditional 30-40% probability)
        2. Visual indication when cards are reversed (rotated 180 degrees)
        3. Reversed card interpretations (different meanings than upright)
        4. Database schema support for reversed meanings
        5. Integration with existing TarotEngine.ts
        
        Analyze the current tarot engine and add reversal functionality.

    dramatic_presentation_task = create_base_task(
        description="""
        Transform reading display into dramatic, spotlight presentation like "Star Wars rolling credits."
        REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Large, prominent text that commands attention
        2. Smooth scrolling or fade-in animation for reading text
        3. Mystical background effects (particles, glow, etc.)
        4. Typography that feels magical and important
        5. Remove weak, understated presentation
        6. Make readings feel like sacred revelations
        
        Design should make users feel the gravitas of their spiritual guidance.

    casino_menu_task = create_base_task(
        description="""
        Redesign the tarot spread selection menu with casino-style visuals.
        CURRENT ISSUES:
        1. Text too small and hard to distinguish
        2. Lacks visual impact and excitement
        3. Doesn't convey the magical nature of different spreads
        
        NEW DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Large, blocky casino-style letters
        2. Animated spread selection options
        3. Images/icons for each spread type
        4. Hover effects and selection animations
        5. Clear visual hierarchy and distinction
        6. Make spread selection feel like choosing your destiny

        The current readings are "weak and understated" - enhance them with your mystical expertise.
        CURRENT READING EXAMPLE:
        "Knight of Pentacles (Reversed) Self-discipline, boredom, feeling stuck, perfectionism
        King of Wands Natural leader, vision, entrepreneur, honour
        Five of Swords Conflict, disagreements, competition, defeat, winning at all costs"
        
        ENHANCEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
        1. Transform basic keywords into flowing, mystical narratives
        2. Connect cards to create cohesive story for the querent
        3. Add emotional depth and spiritual guidance
        4. Include timing and practical advice
        5. Make each reading feel personally meaningful
        6. Use your archetypal knowledge and Jungian insights
        
        Provide enhanced interpretation templates for the three-card spread shown.
