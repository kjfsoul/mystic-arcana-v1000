# # Mystic Arcana — Human Oversight & Data-Driven Symbol Evolution

## Human Oversight Model

- **Feedback review:** All user feedback, rating, and flagged issues are regularly reviewed by human admins/curators.
- **Performance analytics:** Systematic tracking of agent/reader output effectiveness, user satisfaction, retention, and outcome metrics.
- **Intervention:** When patterns of dissatisfaction, unexpected responses, or shifts in user sentiment are detected, human operators intervene—adjusting agent logic, flagging edge cases, and triggering content/model updates.

## Data-Driven Symbol & Interpretation Evolution

- **Dynamic symbolism:**
  - Tarot card and zodiac sign interpretations are not fixed; they _evolve_ based on real user data, performance trends, and emergent archetypes.

- **Statistical feedback loop:**
  - Aggregate/analyze user data (journals, feedback, session outcomes) for statistical differences in how cards/signs are experienced or described by users.
  - Example: If "Virgos" are consistently described as "ferocious leaders" by a statistically significant segment of users (rather than "practical organizers"), the system adapts and surfaces this as a primary interpretation.
  - Example: If "The High Priestess" is most often reported to reflect "disorganization and clutter" in lived experience, that meaning becomes part of her interpretive spectrum.

- **Curated adaptation:**
  - All major changes to card or sign meanings require human review and approval—admins validate, synthesize, and document new interpretations before deployment.

- **Traceability:**
  - Every interpretive shift is logged, attributed ("based on user data, reviewed by \[admin] on \[date]"), and visible to users seeking transparency.
