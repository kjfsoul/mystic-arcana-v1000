# MISSION: Project State Re-validation and Roadmap Alignment

## OBJECTIVE

Conduct a comprehensive audit of the Mystic Arcana codebase. Compare the current implementation against key planning documents (`IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md`, `tarotcreationprocess.docx`, `adaptive_personalization.md`). Produce a definitive "State of the Arcana" report that clearly identifies all completed, in-progress, and incomplete features, with a focus on the Virtual Reader System and UI/UX.

## CONTEXT

This mission is critical to resolve any disconnect and establish a verified baseline for all future work. The swarm must operate with maximum efficiency, using batched commands to read all necessary context and create a structured output.

## EXECUTION PLAN (BATCH COMMANDS)

**// 1. Spawn a dedicated Audit Swarm.**
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "architect", "name": "LeadAuditor" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "researcher", "name": "DocuValidator" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "coder", "name": "CodeScanner" }

**// 2. Read all strategic and technical documents in a single batch.**
Read { "file_path": "IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md" }
Read { "file_path": "tarotcreationprocess.docx" }
Read { "file_path": "adaptive_personalization.md" }
Read { "file_path": "claudeupdate.md" }
Read { "file_path": "agents/registry.json" }
Read { "file_path": "src/components/astrology/InteractiveBirthChart.tsx" }
Read { "file_path": "src/agents/PersonaLearner.ts" } // Stub for the learner agent
Read { "file_path": "src/agents/sophia.ts" } // Stub for the reader persona

**// 3. Create microtasks for the audit.**
mcp__claude-flow__task_create { "name": "Audit Tarot System vs. Docs", "parent": "main" }
mcp__claude-flow__task_create { "name": "Audit Astrology System vs. Docs", "parent": "main" }
mcp__claude-flow__task_create { "name": "Audit Virtual Reader System vs. Docs", "parent": "main" }
mcp__claude-flow__task_create { "name": "Generate Final Report", "parent": "main" }

**// 4. Assign tasks and provide instructions.**
mcp__claude-flow__agent_assign { "taskId": "[ID_FOR_Audit_Tarot_System_vs_Docs]", "agentId": "CodeScanner" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_assign { "taskId": "[ID_FOR_Audit_Astrology_System_vs_Docs]", "agentId": "CodeScanner" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_assign { "taskId": "[ID_FOR_Audit_Virtual_Reader_System_vs_Docs]", "agentId": "CodeScanner" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_communicate { "to": "CodeScanner", "message": "For each assigned system (Tarot, Astrology, Virtual Reader), compare the code implementation against the specifications in `IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md` and the other context files. Identify and list every feature that is a) fully implemented and verified, b) partially implemented (stubbed), or c) not yet started. Pay special attention to the `TAROT_UI_DEMO_READINESS.md` plan and the `InteractiveBirthChart.tsx` functionality. Store your findings in memory under the key `audit/findings/[system]`." }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_assign { "taskId": "[ID_FOR_Generate_Final_Report]", "agentId": "LeadAuditor" }
mcp__claude-flow__agent_communicate { "to": "LeadAuditor", "message": "Retrieve all findings from memory (`audit/findings/*`). Synthesize them into a single markdown document titled `STATE_OF_THE_ARCANA.md`. The report must have clear sections for each major system and use ✅, ⏳, and ❌ emojis to denote completed, in-progress, and pending tasks. This report will become our definitive roadmap." }

**// 5. Update project memory with the results.**
Write { "file_path": "claudeupdate.md", "content": "PROJECT AUDIT COMPLETE. A new definitive status report has been generated at `STATE_OF_THE_ARCANA.md`. All future work will be prioritized based on this document.", "mode": "overwrite" }

## DELIVERABLES

1. A new, comprehensive report file: `/STATE_OF_THE_ARCANA.md`.
2. An updated `claudeupdate.md` file pointing to the new report.
3. Confirmation that the swarm has completed the full audit.
