- `npm run astrology:test-chart` - Requires Python venv activation
- `npm run astrology:test-transits` - Requires Python venv activation
- `npm run email:*` commands - Functional but require SMTP configuration

## Project Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router
- **TypeScript**: ES2017 target, strict mode, bundler module resolution
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, Ant Design components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **WebGL**: Custom WebGL2 renderer for astronomical visualizations
- **Testing**: Jest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **Deployment**: Netlify (primary), Vercel (previews)
- **Security**: Semgrep CI/CD integration with daily scans

### High-Level Architecture Patterns

1. **API-First Design**: Every feature exposes RESTful APIs in `/app/api/`
2. **Feature-Based Organization**: Components grouped by feature domain
3. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic isolated in `/services/`
4. **Context-Based State**: Authentication and session state via React Context
5. **Database Abstraction**: All DB operations through Supabase client
6. **Multi-Brand Support**: Configurable for Mystic Arcana, BirthdayGen, EDM Shuffle

### Critical Requirements

1. **Supabase Vector Extension**: Must be enabled in dashboard for AI features
   - Required for `journal_entries`, `user_embeddings`, `user_interactions` tables
   - See `SUPABASE_VECTOR_SETUP.md` for troubleshooting

2. **Environment Variables** (see `.env.example`):

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   REDIS_URL (default: redis://localhost:6379)
   PYTHON_PATH (for astrology calculations)
   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL (automation workflows)
   ```

3. **Python Integration**: Astrology features require Python virtual environment
   - Create venv: `python -m venv venv-astrology`
   - Install deps: `pip install -r services/astrology-python/requirements.txt`

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Run with `npm run test`
  - Located in `tests/` directory
  - Uses `@/` path alias for imports from `src/`
  - Jest with ts-jest preset and jsdom environment
  
- **E2E Tests**: Run with `npm run test:e2e`
  - Located in `tests/e2e/` directory
  - Uses port 3002 (auto-starts dev server)
  - Chromium browser only

- **Run Specific Tests**:

  ```bash
  npm run test -- tests/specific-test.test.ts
  npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/specific.spec.ts
  ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Email/password fully functional
   - Google OAuth requires Supabase dashboard config
   - Session persists across page reloads
   - Profile creation after signup

2. **Tarot System**:
   - All 78 cards with images in `/public/tarot/deck-rider-waite/`
   - Database seeded via `npm run seed:tarot`
   - API endpoints handle deck operations
   - Reading history persisted to database

3. **Astrology Features** (⚠️ Currently using mock data):
   - Birth charts use fake planetary positions
   - Compatibility/career features disabled
   - Requires Swiss Ephemeris integration for real data

## Agentic Memory & Development Logging (`a_mem`)

**Core Directive:** As an AI developer on this project, your secondary but critical function is to ensure every action is logged to the `a_mem` store. This system is for tracking the development process and is separate from the application's production logging (Grafana Loki).

### 1. Shell Command Logging (Mandatory)

All terminal commands you issue (`npm`, `git`, `npx`, etc.) **MUST** be prefixed with the `memlog-ma` alias. This is non-negotiable.

- **Correct Usage:**
  - `memlog-ma npm run dev`
  - `memlog-ma npm run seed:tarot`
  - `memlog-ma git commit -m "feat: your message"`

- **Incorrect Usage:**
  - `npm run dev`

### 2. Python Instrumentation (When Applicable)

When generating or modifying Python code (e.g., for astrology services), all key functions **MUST** be instrumented with the `@log_invocation` decorator from `utils.a_mem_logger.py`.

- **Purpose:** Logs the execution of the function to the `a_mem` store, capturing internal actions during development and testing.
- **Example:**

    ```python
    from utils.a_mem_logger import log_invocation

    @log_invocation(event_type="astrology_chart_generated", user_id="dev_test")
    def calculate_birth_chart(birth_data):
        # ... function logic ...
        return {"status": "success"}
    ```

### 3. `a_mem` vs. Loki: The Distinction

- **`a_mem` (This System):** Logs the **development process**. You use it via `memlog-ma` and `@log_invocation`. It creates a historical record of how the app was built, tested, and modified.
- **Grafana Loki:** Logs the **live production application's behavior**. It is used by the `Logger` utility inside the Next.js code and is for monitoring, alerting, and debugging the deployed app.

Your responsibility is to ensure the `a_mem` system is used for all development actions.

---

### Code Organization Patterns

1. **Import Aliases**: Use `@/*` for imports from `src/*`
2. **Component Structure**:

   ```
   components/
   ├── feature-name/
   │   ├── FeatureComponent.tsx
   │   ├── FeatureComponent.module.css
   │   └── index.ts

- Offline capability for core features

### Security & Compliance

- Semgrep scans run daily via GitHub Actions
- All user data treated with medical-record level security
- RLS enabled on all Supabase tables
- No secrets in code (use environment variables)
- Legal documents in `/docs/legal/`

### Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Astrology System**: Currently demonstration-only with mock data
2. **Agent System**: 80% conceptual, needs activation for real functionality
3. **Email System**: Functional but requires SMTP configuration
4. **Python Scripts**: Require manual venv activation
5. **Vector Extension**: Must be manually enabled in Supabase dashboard

### Deployment Notes

- **Primary**: Deploy to Netlify (see `netlify.toml`)
- **Preview**: Vercel deployments for PR previews
- **Environment**: Ensure all required env vars are set
- **Database**: Run migrations before deployment
- **Assets**: Tarot images require CDN for performance
