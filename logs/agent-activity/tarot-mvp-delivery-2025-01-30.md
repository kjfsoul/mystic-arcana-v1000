## TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Critical Fix: ES Module Syntax Error

**File**: `/scripts/seed-tarot.ts`

```diff
- require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env.local" });
+ import { config } from "dotenv";
+ config({ path: ".env.local" });

- if (require.main === module) {
+ if (import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`) {
```

**Result**: Database seeding now works flawlessly

### 2. Database Population Verification

```bash
npm run seed:tarot
# Output: ✅ Successfully inserted 78 tarot cards!
```

### 3. API Functionality Verification

curl http://localhost:3003/api/tarot/deck/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 | jq '.cards | length'
