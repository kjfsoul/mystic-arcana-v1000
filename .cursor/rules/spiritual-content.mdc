# Documentation and Spiritual Content Standards

## Spiritual Knowledge Preservation
Maintain academic rigor when documenting traditional tarot and astrological practices while ensuring practical application in digital format. All spiritual interpretations must reference authoritative sources and acknowledge cultural origins.

## Multi-Reader Agent Documentation
Document virtual guide personalities with clear attribution between AI-generated content and human expert knowledge. Each reader's memory and personality development must be tracked for consistency across user sessions.

## API Documentation Standards
Ensure all spiritual guidance features are properly documented for the API-first architecture. Include examples demonstrating respectful handling of sensitive spiritual data and proper error handling during spiritual crises.

## Community and Legal Compliance
Reference live legal documents for GDPR, CCPA, and spiritual counseling disclaimers. Maintain transparency about AI involvement in spiritual guidance while protecting user privacy as sacred trust.
