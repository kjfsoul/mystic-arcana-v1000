# Frontend UX Guidelines

- Mobile-first progressive enhancement
- Progressive disclosure: reveal complexity gradually
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance minimum
- Performance budget: <3 second load times, <100KB initial bundle
- Always indicate when content is AI-generated vs human-created
- Mindful notifications that enhance rather than interrupt spiritual practice
