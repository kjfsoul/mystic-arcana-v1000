# Spiritual Technology Ethics

- Human augmentation over replacement: AI enhances human spiritual advisors, never replaces them
- Authentic guidance: All AI-generated content must feel genuinely helpful, not mechanically produced
- Privacy as sacred trust: Treat user spiritual data with the same reverence as medical records
- Cultural sensitivity: Acknowledge diverse spiritual traditions respectfully
- Accessibility as spiritual justice: Ensure the platform serves users of all abilities and backgrounds
