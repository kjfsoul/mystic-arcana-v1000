# API Architecture Standards

- Every feature must expose clean, documented APIs
- Use RESTful conventions with clear resource naming
- Implement rate limiting and authentication on all endpoints
- Separate astronomical calculations, user management, and content generation into distinct services
- Cache astronomical data intelligently but never compromise accuracy for performance
