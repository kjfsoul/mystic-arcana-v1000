# Configuration and Build Standards

## Multi-Brand Architecture Requirements
Configure build processes to support Mystic Arcana, BirthdayGen, and EDM Shuffle brands with shared infrastructure but isolated user experiences and data.

## Performance Targets for Spiritual Practice
- Galaxy/starfield UI must maintain 60fps with WebGL/Three.js optimizations
- Real-time astronomical calculations under 200ms response time
- Mobile-first PWA capabilities for offline spiritual practice access
- CDN optimization for tarot deck images and celestial chart assets

## Integration Configuration
- MCP server connections for Claude Code and virtual reader agents
- Supabase environment variables with proper staging/production separation
- Swiss Ephemeris and NASA/JPL API configurations for astronomical accuracy
- n8n workflow automation endpoints for content generation and social media
