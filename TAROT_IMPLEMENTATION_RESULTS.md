5. **Reveal Results** → Animated card reveals with meanings
6. **Save Reading** → Automatic database storage for logged-in users
7. **View History** → Access past readings via header link

### 🎯 Verification Tests

#### Manual Testing Required:

1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign up for account
3. Select spread type in tarot section
4. Complete shuffle → cut → draw flow
5. Verify cards display with real images
6. Check reading saves to database
7. Navigate to "My Readings" to see history

#### API Test:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/tarot/deck/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
