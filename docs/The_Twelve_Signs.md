The Twelve Signs

The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac (M. M. Shoemaker, 1904)

In astrology, the zodiac wheel of twelve signs is a symbolic representation of the heavens, subdivided into twelve equal 30° parts based on the ecliptic, or the Path of the Sun over the course of a year, with one year marked by the 360° cycle.

The zodiac wheel is rooted in the motion of the Sun, Moon, and planetary bodies along that ecliptic, forming a beltway, and this zodiac belt encompasses the constellations that lie along the Path. Twelve constellations, forming this zodiac belt, are the backbone of the wheel. In Hellenistic astrology, these signs as divisions mark space, rather than time, and are not literal constellations (compare: a sidereal chart depicting the actual divisions of the zodiac belt based on time).

Thus, this division of twelve signs is the Tropical zodiac, tied to the seasons rather than the actual timed cycle of the constellations themselves. Aries marks the vernal equinox, at the point when the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving northward; Cancer marks the summer solstice; Libra marks the autumnal equinox; and Capricorn marks the winter solstice.

The earliest recording of the twelve zodiac signs is dated to around 700 BC and found in Babylonian astronomy. The path of the sun in the heavens as observed from a geocentric point of view was subdivided into twelve equal coordinate zones. The first Babylonian calendar was keyed to the twelve signs, with the positioning of the sun during the vernal equinox marking the first sign, or Aries (known historically as the First Point of Aries).

From Practical Astrology A Simple Method of Casting Horoscopes (1901) by Comte C. de Saint-Germain, page 22

In the Babylonian star catalogs, the twelve signs were assigned names, which have become the predecessors of the names we ascribe to the twelve zodiac signs today.

The zodiac signs are subdivided into triplicities in four groupings per their elemental qualities:

The signs are further classified into quarternaries in three groupings per the core energy that drives their respective elemental qualities:

Cardinal: Initiators. Action-oriented. Spark, inspire, excel, to pilot. Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn.

Fixed: Stabilizers. Sustainability-oriented. Preserve, to protect. Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius.

Mutable: Changemakers. Progress-oriented. The resistance; to adapt. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces.

With each sign balanced as one in three of four sets and also one in four of three sets, a balanced system emerges, with each specific formula of balance producing a cosmic archetype, a pattern of life experiences, an expression of cosmic change, or how change is produced.

Thus, for example, Mercury in Sagittarius is more dynamic than Mercury in Pisces where it is more sensitive, but since both Sagittarius and Pisces are Mutable signs, both of such natives tend to be changemakers and progress-oriented. Compare, for instance, Jupiter in Libra is more agile from the Air elemental, and an initiator of excellence per its Cardinal quality, but Jupiter in Gemini, also an Air elemental, is similarly agile in mind, but more attuned to resistance than to sovereignty.

The sequence of the twelve zodiac signs from Aries to Pisces also mark the narrative of life cycles and the human experience: the transition into each sign marks key lessons and challenges for the soul to learn from. For balance, each sign has an opposite polarity, and so in Aries, the lesson is personal identity and individual will, whereas the polar opposite in Libra, the lesson is harmonizing with the group; Cancer is about home, family, and one’s inner life, while its polarity Capricorn is about career, social standing, and one’s public life.

Medieval Medical Astrology: Health and the Zodiac Signs

Per medieval medical astrology, the twelve zodiac signs correspond with parts of the body, head to toe. In modern astrology, certain types of spiritual practices are also attributed to the twelve signs. In totality, the above reference table provides both physical and spiritual health correspondences.
