# Agent Discovery & MCP Server Registry

## Last Updated
2025-06-19T00:00:00Z

## Available MCP Servers

### Currently Configured (Status: Unknown)
- **astro.mcp.server:443** - Astronomical data, ephemeris calculations, planetary positions
- **content.mcp.server:443** - Content generation and spiritual validation
- **imggen.mcp.server:443** - Cosmic backgrounds and card image generation
- **payments.mcp.server:443** - Stripe integration and subscription management
- **moderation.mcp.server:443** - Content filtering and spiritual accuracy validation

### Discovery Notes
- All MCP servers currently have "unknown" status - need connectivity testing
- May need to explore open-source alternatives from glama.ai/settings/mcp/servers
- Priority: Establish astro and content servers for core functionality

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Successfully Implemented
- Agent registry system with 6 defined agents
- Brand-specific memory isolation
- Status tracking (active/dormant/failed)
- Capability mapping per agent

### Next Steps
1. Test MCP server connectivity
2. Implement fallback strategies for failed connections
3. Create agent health monitoring
4. Establish error recovery protocols

## Error Patterns & Solutions
*None recorded yet - fresh initialization*

## Performance Metrics
*To be populated as agents become active*

## Recommended Open-Source Alternatives
*To be researched if current MCP servers fail connectivity tests*
