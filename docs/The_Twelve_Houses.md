The Twelve Houses

The 12 Astrological Houses, Signs, and 36 Decans

**THE TWELVE HOUSES**

The First House: Life, Body, Spirit, Beginnings

The first house is also your ascendant or rising sign, which we covered in “The Self” section. This house is an angular or cardinal house, which means what goes on in this house is quite forceful and prevalent in your life, and will often reveal information about yourself you’ve already come to know. It’s also one of the houses in your natal chart that’s going to have the most impact on you.

This is the Helm, destiny in the making, awareness of the self, and angle of fulfillment. Here we see the influences at play before birth. House 1 in a horary chart reading indicates the present status of the matter. In natal astrology, it can reveal aspects of identity and the native’s external character, physical appearance, highest potential, characterization of free will, and core persona or complexion.

In Mundane Astrology: The kingdom and its people; the masses; in a political campaign, signifies the Majority; an organization’s personnel.

The Second House: Livelihood, Possessions, Money Matters

This house will speak to your belongings, to what is yours, and what is supportive of the preceding angular house before it. In this case, the second house supports the angular first house.

In Hellenistic astrology, the second house is the Gate of Hades. Here we also see the influence of Persephone.

Cadent houses indicate areas of learning for us, areas where we must transform ourselves, grow, improve, and further develop from weakness to strength. In other words, cadent houses show areas of nurture, whereas the other houses, the angular and succeedent, can be thought of as more indicative of your nature or what you are born with.

The third house is ruled by Mercury and the element Air. This is the house of communications and will note how you think and then how you communicate what you think to others.

This house is a cadent house, the last house in each quadrant of your natal chart. Planets in this house are often going to have less of an impact on your manifested life path. Yet these houses indicate areas of learning for us, areas where we must transform ourselves, grow, improve, and further develop from weakness to strength.

The twelfth house is ruled by Jupiter under a traditional rulership and Neptune under a modern. It is also governed by the element water. This is the house of self-awareness, but also the house of self-sacrifice. It can denote the nature of personal trials we suffer in our lives, the losses or obstacles we experience as we try to achieve our goals and self-actualization. The twelfth house will tell the story of the hero’s journey, your journey, what you must go through and endure to achieve success.

The house can also show what we perceive to be our limitations, revealing defects in character and one’s personal weaknesses. Since we perceive these attributes to be our limitations, they actually become our limitations as a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. Being conscious of the influences in the twelfth house can help us transform weaknesses into strengths.

The twelfth house is a difficult house. It is the house of suffering, but through suffering, epiphanies and awakenings. It is the house of karmic difficulties, enemies, personal inner crises, and what pains us to bring us toward self-actualization. The twelfth house tells the story of the demons we face to achieve transcendence. And so just as it is the house of hidden challenges, it is also the house of hidden talents and secret gifts for us to discover about ourselves. In past life astrology, what the twelfth house tells us is the result of karmic accounting from our past incarnation.

In Mundane Astrology: Plagues, epidemics; public welfare; correctional facilities and the prison system; incarceration; hospitals and charitable organizations; a nation’s enemies; crimes and criminals; secret societies.
