search for all astrology-related api's that can address any of the following, birth charts, horoscopes, relationship/friendship analysis, planetary movements, advanced astrological plotting knowledge of celestial entities, granular planetary attributes, star/constellation mapping, etc. List as many as are current prioritizing free and opensource options and then proceed with pay api's but they must score high on a cost/benefit analysis

convert your api deep research into an easy-to-decipher table format and include a sensible ranking system based on functionality, ease of implementation, relevance, update recency, costs and other metrics as appropriate. All costs should be in US $ please.

list in totality all the astrological features included or accessible with kerykeion, free astrology api, astrologer api, pyephem, and pyswisseph and specifically address the notion of creating advanced (birth) charts that take into account intergalactic forces and entities to generate a groundbreaking nuanced astrological chart that can also intake major life or planetary historical moments into account to create an evolving ultra-customized chart and interpretation for users. If the above options cannot do this then find a platform or coding method that will. Thank you.

Please give me a brief itemized, prioritized summary of the tools, api's and processes i'll need to fully integrate my base and advanced astrology solutions.

after reviewing all of the options you have laid out to fully scope out my mystic arcana project, what set of tools, platforms, calculations are needed that fit into a free/opensource category or a very cost-effective one. Use the attachments as feature guides that need to be addressed fully and honestly. Claude is helping code my project and has latched onto swiss ephemeris as the go-to but we've talked about many solutions so propose the best 2 stack options please.

please simplify the presentation of your recommendations please to the features and calculations that are needed so i can clearly communicate that to claude code. thank you.

How should I advise Claude? " Let me step back and create a proper implementation plan based on ALL the tools you  
  specified:  
  
⏺ Write(COMPREHENSIVE\_IMPLEMENTATION\_PLAN.md)  
  ⎿ Wrote 224 lines to COMPREHENSIVE\_IMPLEMENTATION\_PLAN.md  
     # COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN  
     ## Using ALL Specified Tools & Database Architecture  
     ### CRITICAL INSIGHT: Database-First Approach  
     You're right - this is a database concern! We should:  
     1. Calculate planetary positions ONCE  
     2. Store them in Supabase  
     3. Query stored data for speed  
     4. Only recalculate for real-time transits  
     … +214 lines (ctrl+r to expand)  
  
⏺ You're absolutely right. I immediately jumped to Swiss Ephemeris without considering:  
  
  1. The complete tool ecosystem you specified (Kerykeion, GeoPy, D3.js, etc.)  
  2. Database architecture - storing calculations instead of computing every time  
  3. Multiple calculation sources for accuracy verification  
  4. The Python tools that might need API wrappers  
  
  Should I start by:  
  1. Creating the database schema for caching ephemeris data?  
  2. Setting up the location service with GeoPy equivalent?  
  3. Researching how to integrate the Python tools (Kerykeion) with our Node.js app?  
  
  What would you prefer as the first REAL step that actually follows your comprehensive plan?"

follow along with Claude's updates and assess if what is claimed is actually completed:

use best practices for prompting Claude Code and write the next prompt for claude which should include an element of validation or provable code snippets
