## AI answer


## User
explain how perplexity labs can incorporate 4 virtual reader personas who continuously learn and adapt based on the users who choose them and how they interact with them thereby developing 4 unique personas based on the community who engages with them. Personas serve as virtual readers, influencing the interpretation of spreads and horoscopes.  
Each persona has unique themes and styling but lacks depth in functionality (e.g., distinct audio, voice, or personality-based interpretations).  
Desired Enhancements:  
Personas should be visually represented as human-like characters with unique personalities and audio.  
Provide different advice/commentary during readings depending on the selected persona.  
Explore unlockable or customizable personas (e.g., animals, planets).  
Introduce gender dynamics, voices, and meaningful variation in reading styles.
