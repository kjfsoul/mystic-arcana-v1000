This is here because blog posts need to be accompanied by images, as you very well know. I typed into ChatGPT the following prompt: “Create an image that is an artistic expression of the [__one-word summary of main occupation, e.g., author, attorney, artist, etc.__] [__name__] based on the published works they’re most known for, public persona and platform, and publicly accessible information about this individual.” This prompt might generate text only, in which case your next prompt will be “Create an image that is an artistic expression of [__name__] based on the foregoing analysis and assessment.” Left image is what ChatGPT produced when I used my legal name and profession of attorney; right image is what it produced for the author Benebell Wen.

Long before AI came on the scene, I had already been wondering if maybe psychic ability in humans wasn’t as woo as we thought, and really, it’s just a rare few people’s brains being able to process “big data” they were somehow downloading from a collective unconscious, spot patterns, and synthesize that data in a way that now appears to the average person as predictive or supernatural.

These algorithms that seem to know exactly what we want to see, who we are, our preferences, core identity, innermost wants and values mirror what people often say about psychics and mediums– “She [the psychic] knows me better than I know myself!”

I believe clairvoyance, clairsentience, and claircognizance are simply functions we have yet to fully understand in a clear, practical way. But really at the heart of it, it’s just cognitive science and pattern recognition, much like what powers AI.

If you got here through the QR code on the box of Fu talismans at  that promised to explain what the talismans were, hello! Since this will be a publicly accessible blog post, if you have no idea what I’m talking about, hello, too — this is just going to be notes to de-mystify a Thing that I’m going to be distributing during two of my lectures.

Here’s what the full sheets look like, outer casing and interior where the actual empowered Fu 符 is. Because of the way it’s going to be folded, you’ll note that the left outer casing view has the Ba Gua printed upside down per that view, but once folded into the final talisman, it’ll be right side up aligned with the interior Fu 符. Same with the 64 stylized sigils (explained below) for medicine, healing, and healer.

This is a 36-card oracle deck that came out back in 2015, and at this point, the production value shows its age, with images that are a smidge blurry, but I wanted to do a quick post so you can have a look-see of the cards.

This is not a deck review. It’s a walk-through where you can click on any of the photos and zoom in for a close-up viewing of the deck.

I’m currently in the process of packing away decks I never use and relocating them to storage. As I logged this deck into inventory, I thought, although I never use it, there’s something about it I really like, and so maybe you will, too. Hence, the quick pause before packing it away to take a few pics and memorialize them in my .

The Playful Heart Tarot and the PipSpeak Tarot by KittenChops

You may be familiar with the  (Zaara), based on the RWS, whereas the latest creation from the KittenChops studios is a Marseille-based pip deck, the PipSpeak Tarot.

After completing the RWS-based Playful Heart Tarot, Zaara redefined her work with the tarot by unpacking her RWS framework and re-learning the tarot with the Marseille. The result is the PipSpeak Tarot, which became a liberating experience. Likewise, this might just be the very deck to get a seasoned RWS reader out of a rut.

From the little white book (LWB) for the PipSpeak Tarot

“Fortune tellers and cunning folk have been reading with Marseille and playing card/pip decks for hundreds of years,” writes the artist. “Instead of esoteric intellectual prowess, these readers have been relying on their common sense, their understanding of human nature and key card reading wisdom passed down from generation to generation.”

In 2024 I shared 12 deck reviews, which I’ll assemble here in this “deck reviews in review” post. With my focus and time directed elsewhere, I haven’t been able to write up as many deck reviews as I had in years past, though you’ll find more , including deck hauls and snapshots of how I work with these decks.

All decks I feature on this site were either gifted to me or sent to me by the publisher for prospective (but never guaranteed) review.

Here’s a revisit of the 12 decks I covered on this site in 2024.

“Emi walks along mirror-like waters, unsure of the depth. The moon reflects off the surface and reveals her past, sometimes painful, memories. Caught between two realities, she reminisces in silence. ‘I remember…'” — from the Guidebook

Tarot of the Guiding Muse is one of those decks that immediately tugs at my heartstrings. The deck follows the personal journey of Emi, and reading about her journey through the archetypal narrative of the tarot, you remember to acknowledge your own personal story amidst the daily chaos.

The deck comes in a magnetic keepsake box with a companion guidebook that reads like a storybook. The guidebook is my favorite feature of the deck set, in fact. It helps you to see the cohesion in the deck art, and fully grasp how holistic the deck concept is.

Dwina Murphy-Gibb’s Vedic Tarot is a bold and ambitious attempt to integrate two rich traditions: the esoteric symbolism of the tarot and the spiritual depth of the Vedic mysteries. With its tagline, “East Meets West,” the deck promises a cross-cultural exploration that bridges divides and celebrates parallels between Eastern spirituality and Western occult wisdom. The result is a visually striking and thought-provoking tool for divination and self-reflection.

Ready! I’ve got my reading glasses on!

I had such a great experience recording the first chapter of my audiobook that I had to share, and memorialize in a blog post. My publisher North Atlantic Books arranged for me to record at Live Oak Studio in Berkeley, a truly fantastic place. This is for the third book, I Ching, The Oracle.

To be standing where music legends and NYT bestselling authors once stood! ::faints::

Boyz II Men, Alicia Keys, Destiny’s Child, Vanessa Williams, En Vogue, Chaka Khan, Lenny Williams, just to name a few of the familiars, have all recorded at this studio before. Destiny’s Child recorded their very first album here! ::fangirl scream:: Instagram has this fun feature where you can tag the location, and then if you, the viewer,  (in this case, ), you can see everybody else’s photos tagged from that location, i.e., in this case, !

Now I kinda wish I had the backbone to ask if I could take some photos of the engineer’s setup, you know, that station in front of the glassed-in studio space with all the colorful levers and buttons. =) But it seemed like his space and I didn’t want to intrude. So, womp, womp, sad face, no impressive sound-engineer’s-giant-keyboard pics for my social media. (Do blogs even count as social media anymore?)

This was my first time in a recording studio,* and certainly my first time recording my voice narrating my own book. I left the experience with a lot of admiration for professional voice actors and audiobook narrators. Like the voice actor we chose for narrating the I Ching audiobook — he sounds like one of those National Geographic or History channel voiceover guys! It’s a skill, and maybe dare say even a talent.

* Technically, I’ve been in a recording studio before, with an entire symphony, as one violinist in a sea of violinists in the violin section of said symphony. But for sure this was my first time in a recording studio for totally-me reasons.

Just because you wrote the Thing doesn’t mean you can competently read the Thing aloud, especially since I would not call my writing style “conversational.” So when you read it aloud and your writing style departs from your personal “conversational” style of speaking, it comes across as awkward.

Fortunately, the sound engineer was fantastic. He coached me really well, telling me when I was speaking 10% too fast and needed to slow down, when my energy wasn’t matching my last paragraph, and flagging words that had just the most subtle stumble, or even when I was getting a bit too loud with my breathing (lol). I have confirmed that audiobook narration is not necessarily the best profession for you if you have asthma (I have asthma).

This audiobook recording experience left me with the unequivocal acknowledgement that I write very long run-on sentences. The sound engineer had to stop and teach me how to breathe. If you come to a really long sentence, even if it doesn’t have punctuation, put in breath marks as if it did have periods, otherwise you’ll run out of breath, as I did when I was reading my own damn book.

More fun tips I’ve learned: Apparently, eat a crisp apple before you start recording voice narration. I don’t know if that’s just folklore or if it’s scientifically legit, but a lot of voice actors swear by it, and believe it’s a thing. It’s supposed to help your voice be at its tip-top condition.

And don’t wear “loud” clothes while you’re recording. So for instance James was wearing a nylon jacket and sporty pants or something that goes swish swish every time he moved even a little, so he wasn’t allowed in the recording booth. Fortunately I’m a nerd who reads all the homework assignment materials ahead of time, so I knew to wear “soft, quiet” clothes.

To be a competent voice actor, you almost have to over enunciate words. So many of us lay people don’t realize that we mumble when we speak. There were several instances when the sound engineer stopped me and offered guidance on how to over-enunciate, because I was jumbling my words and it wasn’t as crisp as it could or should be.

For I Ching, The Oracle, I’ll be doing the voice narration for Chapter 1, the Introduction only. A pro audiobook narrator, Wyntner Woody, will be narrating the rest of it, speaking both the classical Chinese text of the Zhouyi and the English translation and annotations.

The Hubby (a native Beijingnese speaker) and I listened and re-listened– and re-listened– to the finalist list of audition reels. We debated, we re-listened, we looked up each one of their bios… which is to say we put a lot of heavy thought into who to choose. There were many different and competing factors for consideration, hence the debating and long deliberation time as we wracked our brains over who to go with.

For the audition, each voice actor recorded about a page or two from one of the introductory expository chapters and then recorded Hexagram 1, both the classical Chinese and the English. We (and particularly Hubby, because he’s the native standard Chinese speaker; the Mandarin I speak is not standard) ultimately went with Wyntner because of his more precise standard Chinese pronunciation.

Why didn’t I want to narrate the entirety of my own book? This is the analogy I give. Since I grew up listening to southern Taiwanese people (deep south) whose primary tongue is Minnan/Hokkien speaking Mandarin Chinese, my Mandarin pronunciation is not “standard Chinese.” If I had narrated my own I Ching book, it would be akin to listening to someone narrate Shakespeare with a heavy southern drawl. If you’re looking to voice Shakespeare, you’re looking for a particular way of pronunciation, right? Same here.

That and time constraints. I think the total was going to be something like 20 hours of straight narration, which means lord knows how many hours buffered around those core 20 to get those final 20 hours right.

Due to my full-time job, I would only be able to work weekends, and then you would have to coordinate with the studio’s schedule and available time slots. So ultimately it did not make sense for me to narrate my own book, and for the publisher to hire a pro.

Oh by the way, I learned that reading aloud 9,000 words equals about 1 hour of studio time. So the way they estimate how much studio time to book is based on word count. It’s not an exact accurate science, but ballpark more or less, 9,000 words is 1 hour of recorded audio.

Hubby, wearing “loud” clothes, and therefore banned from the recording booth.

Plus, James (the hubby) is more of an audiobook listener than I am, and he says that any time he sees that the book is narrated by the author, he skips it and won’t listen, because it has been his experience, as a consumer of audiobooks, that the author’s narration tends to be a bit too amateur to listen comfortably to for dozens of hours on end, and that you really do need a pro to do it. Voice acting is totally a skill. Not just anybody can or should be narrating audiobooks.

There are other interesting issues that come up with bilingual (even multilingual) narration. So, for example, Wyntner pronounces “I Ching” as you would in Mandarin Chinese, per pin yin, even when it’s in the context of an English sentence, whereas when the context is English, I just pronounce “I Ching” and even “yin and yang” the way a typical American would pronounce those words.

But then in other instances, mid-sentence while speaking English I’ll hop over and pronounce it as you would in Chinese. Wyntner is super consistent with his stylistic approach, whereas I, a lay speaker, am very inconsistent. Sometimes I pronounce “Tao Te Ching” the way you would in Chinese, per pin yin, and then other times, without explanation or rationale, I’ll pronounce it the way average Americans might pronounce it.

It’s a phenomenon you’ll observe — native Chinese speakers and non-Chinese expat/foreign speakers speaking Chinese will switch pronunciation midstream in English, and try to pronounce Chinese words as you would per pin yin, but Asian Americans do not. Asian Americans pronounce in the Chinese way when speaking Chinese, and then pronounce it the white people way when speaking English.

For example, when James pronounces his own Chinese surname in English, he’ll kind of give it a proper Chinese pronunciation to it. Whereas when I pronounce my own Chinese surname in English, I’ll just pronounce it the way white people might pronounce it, and don’t bother giving the proper pronunciation. But obv. will pronounce it the “right” way when I’m speaking Chinese. Or how you’ll hear Wyntner pronounce yang as “yahng,” with the soft-A like “ah,” which is correct, whereas I just go with the Americanized hard-A “yayng,” like “yay,” which is incorrect but has become normalized.

In any case, Hubby and I are both super glad we went with Wyntner, and we cannot wait for the final result to be out in the world!

James is currently proofing Wyntner’s narrations, listening to the entire audiobook, and he reports that my book is actually very, very interesting! =) Yay! James says that my I Ching book is so interesting to listen to that he even paused between sections to go look stuff up and read more on the history! I’ve earned myself a new fan, in the form of Hubby! =D [I mean, it’s not like he read a single page of Holistic Tarot or The Tao of Craft, so this is ah-mazing!]

As for the I Ching audiobook, it is going to be significantly different from the printed book, for many reasons. One, the audiobook omits all the exercises (basically the whole “grimoire” part of the book), the entire divination how-to section (so the audiobook has nothing in there that teaches you how to do the divination procedure, whereas the printed book dedicates a big whopping chapter to all the ways), and any passages that reference tables, charts, or images had to go, or be rewritten so that you’re not making references to phantom visuals.

My justification for omitting the how-to-actually-do-an-I-Ching-divination chapter from the audiobook version is (1) I couldn’t get it to make sense as pure audio, because you can’t see anything, which is why the printed book was chock full of photos and diagrams, and (2) I have ; such tutorials make more sense as videos than as audio-only. And most of .

The I Ching audiobook’s purpose, as I see it, is to hear the classical Chinese recitations of the hexagram verses side by side with the English translation and then my annotations. The chapters that cover the history, mythology, and cultural lore of the I Ching also makes sense as an audiobook. But the more practical hands-on elements, I feel, need to be either in printed book form, with the written instructions plus illustrative images, or as a video tutorial.

Also, the audiobook does not include any of the end notes. In a few select instances, Wyntner recommended that he include a few additional statements to integrate some of what I wrote in the end notes, as he felt the explanatory material in the end notes would help provide clarity to the text, and we agreed.

I rewrote a lot of the annotations and commentaries to the Zhouyi translations (the actual I Ching text) so it would read better as an audiobook. Also, I totally rewrote the Introduction that I narrated. About half of it stayed the same as the printed version of the Intro, but then about half of it is net new. Even two hours before heading to the recording studio I was still on my computer rewriting passages!

In any event, unlike the challenges, obstacles, and frustrations I encountered during the publisher-author collaboration phase of the print book for I Ching, I really, genuinely enjoyed my experience during the publisher-author collaboration phase for the audio book version.

If you’re from the corporate world you might have heard of the Six Sigma quality management methodology or the acronym DMAIC blah blah but even if you haven’t, no worries. This is just a tarot spread inspired by Six Sigma principles and that process flow of D (Define), M (Measure), A (Analyze), I (Improve), and C (Control).

This card reading method (it’s workable with an oracle deck, not just tarot) is less in the space of mysticism or divination, and more in the space of pragmatism and driving you to be a more creative and critical thinker.

The Missing Witches Deck of Oracles: Feminist Ancestor Magic for Meditations, Divination, and Spellwork was released earlier this year in July 2024. It is a 52-card deck that invites the reader to connect with the histories of women who defied convention, and often those who were marginalized. There is a bit of an implied conflation of “feminist” and “witch,” which will resonate with some, and might not resonate for others.

I have had a straggly streak of white hair at the crown of my head since adolescence. I believe it’s known colloquially as a Mallen streak, and medically as poliosis circumscripta, when a patch of hair at the front or crown of your head goes white due to hypopigmentation, i.e., low melanin.

It’s often associated with autoimmune conditions, which funny enough, is itself associated with the hyper-sensitivity that results in psychic and mediumship abilities. The Mallen streak condition is also linked to seriously bad eyesight or hearing, meaning if you have one, you’re more likely to have the other, which is funnier yet, because that’s associated with amplified clairvoyance and clairaudience.

Aligned with all that, since medieval times a Mallen streak has been considered a marker of divergent, anomalous, or maligned personalities, a birthmark that points to witchcraft and transgression. In Chinese folk tradition, a woman’s hair turning white or getting streaks of white in an untimely way is a sign of supernatural influence.

This is an independent study course that delves into reading a birth chart for past life and karmic insights, to explore soul patterns through natal astrology.

For more than a decade I have had on my back burner of book manuscripts a multi-volume encyclopedia on astrology, where I want to cover both Western and Eastern modalities of astrology, through the Ages.

One of those volumes was or would have been on past life astrology, but then after more thinking, that particular subject isn’t something I want traditionally published as a book. It’s not something I want to become “known” for. That meant I now had hundreds of pages of astrological reference material that I didn’t know what to do with.

So I created this handbook to be packaged into an online independent study course. One recommended prerequisite: You have intermediate proficiency with Western astrology.

This article is for one who has already built a solid foundation at reading astrological birth charts and is now interested in giving professional chart readings to the public. Having done professional chart readings for the public for the last 12 years, I’ve learned a great deal from my experiences and have tweaked, refined, and streamlined an effective approach, which I’m now sharing with you.

General Overview vs. Addressing a Specific Subject

First, make sure both you and the client are clear on what type of birth chart reading the client wants.

Are they new to natal astrology and want a general overview of their chart’s key highlights, in which case you will be touching in on all the major topics, i.e., personality profile, strengths, weaknesses, career, love, money, health?

Or does the client want you to assess their birth chart and deep-dive into one specific area, i.e., analyze their chart for career metrics, analyze their chart for prosperity metrics, or tell them about their black moon Lilith placement and how Lilith impacts other natal placements?

I had set the timing to 30 minutes for a reason. It’s a digestible amount of time for  both astrologer and client. However, it also means you need to manage that time. As you probably know already, a birth chart can take you down any myriad number of immersive rabbit holes, which just does not make sense to go down in a 30 minute reading.

Personally, even for a general reading, I like to get a sense for what my client wants to know about, or which placements they’re already familiar with and not so familiar with, that way I can make the best use of our time together. If they’re an intermediate astrologer themselves, then I’m not going to spend much time explaining their sun, moon, and rising, and instead get into some of the more obscure placements. If they hardly know what their sun sign is and didn’t even know the ascendant was a thing, then yes, we’re gonna begin with sun, moon, rising.

Preparation

I do think you need to prepare in advance of the actual delivery of insights. Or, if it’s a situation where you get the chart and then need to start interpreting it right away, before you begin, give yourself a few minutes to study the chart and jot down key notes. Why?

A birth chart itself covers so much ground and has so much to say on every facet of the native’s life path, that if I don’t jot down key notes to anchor myself, I can get lost in the weeds. At least for me, if I don’t take a minute of quiet study to outline main talking points, I’ll end up rambling about all sorts of tangential “fun, nerdy” features in the chart that may or may not interest the querent, and also, if you ramble on too many tangents, it’s going to make it harder for the querent to connect the dots and leave with any cohesive takeaway points.

Your preparedness essentially determines how productive and cohesive the client’s reading experience from you will be.

Level-Setting at the Start

These are going to be prepared, even canned remarks that you always make at the start of a reading session, unless it’s a repeat client who is already familiar with your style and approach.

Mine are along the lines of, hi, I’m going to be reading your chart in Whole Signs Tropical. I’ve learned to do this preemptively because sometimes clients who have previously seen their charts but in Placidus only will freak out.

Then you cover your personal philosophical approach as an astrologer. I think this is important because astrologers vary. This level-sets with your client. So, for instance, I’ll say something to the effect of my approach to birth charts is as a divine strategic plan mapped out for you at the moment of birth, but you choose your own path, and when all is said and done, you make your own fortune. That’s because challenges you were born with can be overcome, and blessings you were born with can be lost.

By the way, this is something you can get out of the way before a session, at the time a session is booked. My preference is to get all this preliminary level-setting to a client way in advance of a booking.

Open with a Sound Bite

Begin the 30-minute reading by stating your thesis, or what stood out to you the most about the native’s chart. Be able to summarize it in a few sentences, something that will be a memorable takeaway for the client.

Admittedly, this seemingly no-brainer lesson took me a long time to learn. Astrology can be overwhelming, and as an astrologer you’ve already devoted so much of your learning to the technical elements of astrology that it doesn’t even feel technical to you anymore. You can just rattle off what you’re seeing in the chart, one thing after another, and get excited, but from the client’s perspective, you’ve covered way too much, and now they’re overwhelmed. They recall that you said a lot, but can’t pin down anything too specific.

So beginning with that “best of” in a sound bite is going to help frame the reading session.

House & Sign Approach vs. Subject by Subject

When I say “House & Sign,” I mean that your approach to interpreting a birth chart for a client is to, say, start with the ascendant and talk about the implications of what’s happening in their House 1 and the zodiac sign ruling it, then move on to House 2, then House 3, all the way around the wheel.

The “Subject by Subject” approach is to have a set skeleton outlining the topics you will be covering and then just interpreting the key placements addressing taht topic. For example, you start with personality and disposition, so cover the sun, moon, and rising, and then generally gloss over any of the personal planets and key sensitive points that go toward personality profile. Then you talk about love and romance, and explain what the chart has to say about that, then career metrics, health, personal spirituality, early childhood, adulthood, fears, hopes, etc.

Which approach an astrologer prefers is a matter of subjective opinion and style, I think. Personally, I will choose which approach best suits the type of astrological reading that is being requested, and maybe even choose which approach based on what I intuit the client wants from me.

If you are a pro astrologer who will be offering written readings, I would recommend drafting a boilerplate template for both approaches, then selecting which template to start with based on the client’s specific needs.

House & Sign Approach

For the House & Sign Approach, I would just go in sequential order starting from House 1. Start by explaining what House 1 in a birth chart reveals about the native. Example: House 1 in your chart typically represents selfhood, your destiny in the making, capacity for self-development, and even physique.

Then identify the zodiac sign ruling the native’s first house, what that generally tells us about the native, and then get into the planetary occupants, plus any key personal sensitive points. For the ascendant house specifically, I’d also mention chart ruler and then quickly cross-reference to talk about that planet. Close with any notable angular aspects that the planets or sensitive points in that house are tethered to.

Pros: This approach gives the client a very comprehensive map of their birth chart and what every horoscopic piece of the sky pie says about them.

Cons: For a client who is not very familiar with astrology in general, the house & sign approach can be overwhelming. Also, depending on how much you want to cover about each house, 30 minutes might not be enough.

For a chart reading on a narrowly-tailored specific subject, such as the client wants a deep-dive into what their chart says about life purpose, in the House & Sign Approach, you would simply filter the assessment of each house through that specific lens.

Subject by Subject Approach

For the Subject by Subject Approach, have a prepared outline template. For example, (1) Personality Profile (focusing on a reconciliation of the sun, moon, and rising, and perhaps Mercury implications on their way of thinking), (2) Prosperity metrics (focusing on the second house, Jupiter, Lot of Fortune, and eighth house), (3) Career Potential and Social Status, (4) Love and Romance; Compatibility, (5) Pursuit of Happiness (fifth house, to address their personal approach to creativity), (6) Inner Shadow, Weaknesses to Work On, Areas for Personal Development, and any other specific areas you as an astrologer like to focus on.

Pros: Let’s be candid with each other here, this approach hits directly into what the client wants to know, and is structured in a digestible format.

Cons: It is my opinion that this approach is less conducive for the client learning any core astrology basics. This approach feeds them the most immediately relevant information about their life path that they would want to know, but they won’t come away with any astrology 101 know-how with respect to what each house in the chart says about them.

For a chart reading on a narrowly-tailored specific subject, then in applying the Subject by Subject Approach, the outline of what to cover would be sub-topics within the specific subject.

Uncommon Placements

As a seasoned astrologer, you’re going to immediately spot the uncommon features in a natal chart. When you scan the chart holistically, what stands out the most? A grand trine? Stellium? Grand cross? All the planets congregate on just one hemisphere? A whole lotta retrogrades going on? [And before an astrologer slides into the comments to say, “Well actually,” yes, sure, what constitutes “uncommon” is quite the range.]

When to address uncommon placements is probably going to depend on how the reading is going, and what your preferences are as an astrologer. Maybe you start with these observations before getting into the House & Sign or Subject by Subject approach. Maybe it’s something you bring up mid-stream when it’s relevant. Maybe you close with it. Or more likely, it varies from reading to reading.

I just bring this up because at some point during the 30-minute session, I think it’s useful (and entertaining) to directly address uncommon placements and talk about its implications. Everyone wants to know what’s uncommon about their birth chart, what makes them unique. So I would say it’s an important point to highlight.

How Much Astro Lingo to Use

This is, of course, an ever challenging balance to strike. A stereotype that astrologers get is using too much technical astrology jargon. Sometimes, a client just wants to know who they’re most compatible with or what their chart says about optimal career paths.

Maybe they’re not interested in you rattling off all their angular aspects, implications of decan rulership, or that their natal Mercury cazimi in Virgo.

Or…maybe they are. Because unique and uncommon astrological features are going to be of interest to a client, because we all want to know the ways we are extraordinary. 😉 And some clients are extra nerdy and want to know all the technical things.

So I don’t necessarily have any one-size-fits-all tips or advice here, except to say that as a pro astrologer, be ever mindful of striking this balance.

The Conclusion, or Closing Remarks

I find it helpful to close by reiterating that opening sound bite you gave, recapping the three most notable points you covered during the reading, and if it wasn’t covered already, a summary note on dominant modality, elemental balancing, and chart shape.

Also, leave a few minutes at the end for follow-up questions. Then, the final imprint you leave the client with should be something that feels like an affirmation, is positively validating, or an empowering, motivational takeaway message.

Although I am not of the mind that one should be nice-washing and being superficially positive, the style of your delivery of the information should be empowering, not disempowering. You can deliver bad news but still do it in a way that preserves the querent’s sense of control and fuels their willpower. If a chart reading does not do that for the client, then in my opinion, there is no reason to be giving a chart reading. A chart reading is purposeless without imparting upon the client an actionable plan.

Difference Between a 30-Minute and Hour-Long Reading

I mean, it basically comes down to scope. A 30-minute reading means you’re going to give just the highlights reel. An hour-long reading is when you can dig a little deeper and also include more angular aspects, or go beyond the standard roster of planets and talk about asteroids.

My reason for bringing this up is to remind you of how you want to approach time constraints. You don’t want to approach a 30-minute reading the same way you would approach a 60-minute reading, because if you do, you will run out of time during the 30-minute reading, and become repetitive and run out of things to say during the 60-minute reading. So be ever aware of the time constraints.

I also find that, incidentally, there’s a bit more education involved during the hour-long session, where the querent will also receive the bonus of actually learning a thing or two about astrology basics. Whereas I don’t think that inclusion of material belongs in a shorter form reading.

The Baopuzi 抱樸子 (circa 300 – 343 AD) by the celebrated alchemist and polymath Ge Hong 葛洪 is a Taoist grimoire that I would posit to be the most if not one of the most influential and impactful texts on Taoist mysticism.

Birthed during the global pandemic, The Fool’s New Journey Tarot is a 60-card deck that reorganizes the familiar order of the traditional 78. “Sixty Triumphs for a New Dawn.”

First ten trumps of the Fool’s New Journey

Per the deck description on the box: “In 2020, the world changed. The arrival of a worldwide pandemic ensured it could never be quite the same again. In the same way, facing new issues at every level of life, it is time for Tarot to change. The Fool must begin a new journey.”

“The Fool represents the soul of everyman . . . and goes through the life experiences depicted in the 21 cards of the Major Arcana,” wrote Eden Gray over half a century ago. The Majors, noted Gray, were like archetypes of the subconscious.

But why only these 21 cards of the Majors, as depicted by Pamela Colman Smith no less, as the immutable model for every tarot deck produced?

Trumps 50 – 57 in the Fool’s New Journey

So begins the questioning that led to The Fool’s New Journey, a new sequence of cards that speak with the archetypal voice governing all beings on earth (to borrow language from Caitlin Matthews).

Second decade of trumps in the Fool’s New Journey

John Matthews then collaborated with artist Charles Newington for these new archetypal tarot images. Together, the two set out to create imagery that would be stripped of the traditional imagery as much as possible, and to keep these picture cards simple. Matthews then set these images into a new order, a reset of the tarot.

These 60 trump cards present a new look at the tarot, literally a new journey for The Fool. And yet it’s funny that we think of this as a diverging path from traditional tarot, because in its heyday, circa 15th and 16th centuries, we had the  of 96 cards, , which was also considered a tarot, and the quite popular pre-Golden Dawn  that has an ordering of the Majors to confound today’s RWS readers.

Cards 1 through 5

The journey of The Fool represents the journey of life itself, and so the premise here would be that we, the everyman, all begin before The Maze (Key 1). In the natural course, we then must embody The Believer (Key 2), but before we can move into the role of The Magician, we must confront The Shadow (Key 3). If The Magician is skill and cleverness, The Priestess (Key 5)  is wisdom and intuition. I love that in this New Journey, The Priestess is Key 5, what had been the traditional position of The Hierophant.

Anyone else notice the intensity of recent conversations swirling around so-called girl bosses and trad wives?

Funny enough, as I nosily listen in on video essays, podcasts, and commentaries, I’ve been sketching the Eight and Nine of Swords from my Etteilla deck.

Now you’re like, wait what does the Eight and Nine of Swords in the tarot have to do with girl bosses and trad wives?

I thought nothing. But the illustrations I seem to have subconsciously done at this time sure are amusing.

Chronologically I worked on Card 56, the Eight of Swords first, which appears to give off girl boss energy, then moved on to Card 55, the Nine of Swords, which one might identify with trad wife.

This blog post is another installment of my Etteilla Tarot art project status updates.

At the same time I thought it’d be fun to pepper in some rambling on this whole trad wives, girl bosses conversation du jour.

I’m a huge Thorn Mooney fan. I’ve been following her work since, gosh, over a decade ago when people were still uploading grainy YouTube videos of late-night ramblings about the Craft. Witches Among Us: Understanding Contemporary Witchcraft and Wicca (Llewellyn Books, Oct. 2024) is her third book.

In writing Witches Among Us, Mooney wears dual hats: that of the religious studies scholar and that of a longtime practitioner with experience in multiple traditions. In reviewing Witches Among Us, I’m wearing the hat of someone who is witch-adjacent. I do believe I am within the target readership because I am not part of the in-group of contemporary witchcraft or Wicca, and therefore I am reading this book to learn more about that group.

If you’re not a very disciplined, organized, love-to-do-research, always-did-your-homework Type A personality with strong Virgo vibes, then skip this blog post entirely and do not try to DIY intellectual property law. Hire an attorney.

Even if you are all that, this is not legal advice. I am not your attorney. This is a free-for-all blog post you came across on the internet, on a website about fruity-tutti metaphysical arts no less, so if you leave with even a few nuggets of insight to get you started on the right track, call it a win. Which is to say, do not blissfully rely on what I’ve said here. Apply critical thinking.

But… For an attorney to do the due diligence, put together the application, and steer your trademark through registration with the USPTO, it can cost around $2,500 if it’s a simple, un-problematic trademark. And if you’ve got unique circumstances or someone ends up challenging your mark, then the fees will skyrocket out of control.

If that sounds like way more than you’re willing to spend, well the good news is technically you can file a trademark without a lawyer. Yes, technically it can be DIY, though that comes with quite a bit of risk. If you do it wrong, your application will get rejected, you won’t get your trademark registered, and you will be out of pocket the $250 or $350 you paid for the filing fee (no refunds).

Nevertheless, I’ve always been a do-it-yourself (DIY) type and if you’re kinda like that too, and you are willing to roll up your sleeves and do a lot of research, homework, and study yourself, and you accept the risks of DIY trademark registration, then maybe you don’t need to hire a lawyer or take your chances with one of those discount run-of-the-mill legal services websites. Maybe you can shoot your shot and try to register your trademark on your own.

Here are the basics.

I stumbled upon an online discussion criticizing Fabrizio Pregadio’s translation of gui 鬼 to “demon, devil” [in Encyclopedia of Taoism (2008)], calling this translation inaccurate and problematic. The commenters in that discussion thread preferred the translation of gui to “ghost,” emphatically declaring that gui as ghost is the right approach, and that equating gui to demon or devil is wrong.

The rationale was that demon and devil have a connotation of evil in the West, which the term gui does not have. The term “ghost” is a bit more neutral – they say – and so gui as ghost is the better translation.

Prismatic edging on the deck.

The Cat Aura Tarot tunes in to the magical perspective of cats, and like the intellect of cats, this deck is so much more, as you’ll soon see. “These curious, courageous, and happy felines have so many stories to share with you,” writes , the deck creatrix, author, and cat mom who is the proprietor of .

She teams up with , whose highly detailed nature and animal art is absolutely mesmerizing. Be sure to check out .

This deck is calibrated to work with the chakra system and with our auras. Per the guidebook, chakras are energy centers in our bodies, whereas auras are the electromagnetic field surrounding our body in a way that reflects the health of our chakras.

The colors of our auras reflect the color spectrum of chakras. So, for instance, a yellow-gold aura is telling us something about the dominance of the solar plexus chakra in that person; a green aura communicates something about the heart chakra, and a violet aura communicates something about the crown chakra, etc.

While lurking I recently saw a comment that made me smile and chuckle. A person had asked whether the SKT would be a tarot deck suitable for total beginners. This person also e-mailed us at abelldelivers (which only the hubby J checks with any frequency, and I only respond back to emails delivered there if J has nagged me at minimum five times to sit down and reply to the querent to answer the question goddammit). Other times J will come in to my room, rephrase the person’s question, get my response, and I guess rephrase my response to answer that person directly. This turned out to be one of those other times.

In that thread, the commenter writes that we had replied to their inquiry and said that “yes, there is no reason why this deck could not be used as a beginner’s deck.”

The illustrations for the Cosmic Wisdom Tarot has this nostalgic and heartwarming animations-of-your-childhood storybook style to it that is then paired with one of the coolest tarot card meanings guidebook I’ve come across.

Cosmic Wisdom Tarot Guidebook – page spread for The Magician card

I love the creative mind-map layout for the card meanings. Each card comes with a definitive “this card means yes” or “this card means no” in the case of asking a yes or no question to the cards. I love the bullet points of keywords and single-sentence thesis for each card, upright and reverse, and then the breakdown of symbolism, which is also going to help you learn the RWS system.

The Cosmic Wisdom Tarot is outfitted to be a great beginner’s deck, if you or someone you know is looking for one, because in addition to the RWS-keyed deck art, the guidebook does a great job presenting the tarot as a versatile tool, whether you are interested in learning it for divination, for self-discovery and personal growth, spiritual cultivation, or for inspiring your creativity.

In my video “,” I made a passing reference to the Six Ancestral Sage Kings (or Six Holy Kings) and their significance in Taoism, promising that I’d dedicate a standalone video on the subject, so here we are.

Everything you need to learn about the Tao can be learned from the Six Holy Kings – or so goes an axiom credited to Confucius.

He isn’t the only one to uphold the Six Kings as the paragon of aspirational virtue and wisdom. Even Confucianism’s rival school of thought, the Mohists, would name-drop the Six Kings, 堯舜禹湯文武.

Cultural references to the importance of the Six Holy Kings continues well into the modern era with the founding of the Republic of China. Sun Yat-sen cited the importance of the new Republic upholding the tradition and values of the Six Holy Kings (“中國有一個道統，堯、舜、禹、湯、周文王、周武王、周公”).

Chinese historian and philosopher Li Zehou 李泽厚 notes that the Six Holy Kings are shamanic rulers, wū 巫, and that their divine right to sovereignty comes from their alignment with Heaven, which is received on the basis of their abilities to commune with Heaven. The shamanistic-historical traditions of the Chinese civilization comes straight from the Six Holy Kings. (You can read more about this in Chapter 10 of I Ching, The Oracle.)

Just thought it’d be fun to share some snapshots of how I mark up my copy of I Ching, The Oracle with notes.

Every facet of my disposition – even fate, the cards I’ve been dealt in life – seems to be on a cusp. Astrologically by both Eastern and Western charts I’m a cusp baby. Cultural identity wise, mine is the hyphenated experience. I’m agnostic when it comes to party lines, but you’ll certainly hear the far right calling me too woke, and the far left calling me too trad.

I’m often too structured and austere for the creative arts community and too sensitive, too mystical-leaning for the corporate world. I like agendas, strategic plans, and realistic goal-setting; I value efficiency, utility, and productivity, all attributes that do not go over well with the creative arts community. I also account for unseen influences, trust my psychic impulses, and value empathy, compassion, mercy, softness, vulnerability, and kindness, attributes heavily frowned upon in the corporate world.

“When rationality runs dry, it’s Red that will reconcile this world, a hue vibrant and vital inside its brown.”

And so opens Chapter 1, Zero, of Red Tarot: A Decolonial Guide to Divinatory Literacy by Christopher Marmolejo. This is going to be a tarot book like no other. I can tell already. :: hearts for eyes ::

“To be born, this work broke open my heart, and so let this reading be opened by my blood offering, a requisite pound of flesh…”

Marmolego’s writing is going to draw out your feels, that’s for sure. Either you will be fully onboard this train or you will be left scratching your head. You’ll see what I mean. Let’s continue.

Red Tarot is not an easy read, but it’s not intended to be. It’s filled with dense layers covering symbolism, mythology, history, present day politics, literature, and so much more. This book is about shedding red light on each card in the tarot to reveal it as a prism of political praxis, inspired after Prof. Sandy Grande’s Red Pedagogy.

Each tarot card entry draws from four key disciplines:

literary fiction as political expression,

gender studies and theory,

anti-colonialist philosophy of education and decolonizing pedagogy, and

performance studies, whereby theatrics, divination rituals, ceremonial rites, and social expressions are revelatory of core truths in the human experience.

This is achieved by weaving in the teachings of Toni Morrison, bell hooks, Paulo Freire, and José Esteban Muñoz.

Also known as the: 三皇文 (sān huáng wén); 三皇經 (sān huáng jīng); 三皇内文 (sān huáng nèi wén); Version transmitted to Ge Hong: 小有三皇文 (xiao you sān huáng wén)

Is the Seal of the Nine Immortal Realms 九老仙部印圖 from the Secret Book of the Three Sovereigns 三皇內文遺秘, which is now canonized in the Daozang, or Taoist Canons, part of the lost, legendary grimoire, the Book of the Three Sovereigns 三皇文?

According to lore, during the Three Kingdoms Era (220 – 280 AD), the Taoist mystic and later an ascended master Bó Hé 帛和 finds this text buried inside a stone wall atop Mount Xīchéng 西城山. From Bó Hé’s teachings arose of the earliest traditions of Taoist magic: the School of Bó Taoism 帛家道 (bó jiā dào), or The Way of Bó. Popular among the upper class during the Jin (266 – 420 AD) and Wei (386 – 534 AD) dynasties in the northern central plains of China, the tradition focused on study of the Book of Three Emperors and formulated their own approach to talismanic magic, invocation of gods, and alchemy.

Then, around 300 AD, atop Mount Songshan 嵩山, the Taoist occultist Bao Liang 鲍靓 receives this text painted on silk, as transmitted to Bó Hé. Bao Liang was a renowned master of various occult practices, from astrology and alchemy to necromancy. He married his daughter Bao Gu to the alchemist Ge Hong.

Last Updated 2024 March 8

**THE DISCLAIMERS:**

This is not legal advice.

I am not your attorney.

These documents are provided for general educational purposes only.

All documents are keyed to the State of California (I’m a California and New York licensed attorney.)

Laws change frequently and so the laws applicable at the time these documents were drafted may be outdated by the time you see these documents.

You should not be using these documents as-is.

You should retain legal counsel in your jurisdiction to give you detailed and specific legal advice custom-tailored to your estate planning needs.

These documents bear significant legal implications, so if you do not fully understand what you are reading in the documents, then do not use them. Seek qualified legal counsel to assist you.

Always consult the legal professionals in your region to ensure that your estate plan is aligned with local laws and regulations.

**THEN WHY PROVIDE THESE?**

Times are tough and not everyone can afford an attorney. If you weren’t going to do anything at all and were going to die intestate (i.e., die without a will, trust, or any estate planning in place), then this is better than nothing.

SO… if you were planning on doing nothing, then this last will and testament template plus funeral instructions codicil, even the power of attorney and medical directive would be a step up from nothing.

My family has had to learn firsthand that there is a big difference at probate court between someone dying without a will in place vs. someone with a valid will. Do your loved ones who survive you a huge favor by getting a last will and testament in place.

But if you were planning on hiring an attorney to do your estate planning, then IGNORE THIS POST and do not use these documents. Rely on your attorney’s counsel.

Even if you don’t (and shouldn’t!) use these documents as provided, they’re a good starting point of reference for you to consider how you want to approach your own estate plan and what you would need to gather for safekeeping within that plan.

Also, if you are a licensed attorney yourself but aren’t a wills and trusts attorney, then you may find these starter templates useful.

I dare say this though– if you’re the detail-oriented, research-loving Type A personality who can capably do your own complex tax returns and you negotiate your own contracts, with a spirit of diligence and precision toward all things DIY, then it’s not terribly hard to start with these templates and create your own estate plan. Just sayin’. =P

It’s been a while since I gave an Etteilla deck-in-progress update. I finished working on Card 18, The Hermit, oft named The Capuchin (an order of Franciscan friars) or simply titled with the keyword “Traitor.”

As I was drawing, I got to thinking about the qi in works of art, per the qi of their artists. That in turn got me thinking about the qi of AI and AI-generated images.

If we are to believe in the principle of qi as a force imbued in all things that are sentient or created by sentient beings, then works of art have qi.

In fact, that has always been one of the fundamental factors of valuing art from a Taoist perspective — assessing the qi of the artist’s hand apparent in the art.

As a tarot deck creator, it’s not enough to just do the art; you have to create social media content with your works-in-progress to keep up engagement….. Otherwise, how will you get people to buy your deck once you’re done with it?….

I saw an editor friend’s  by Rebecca Jennings. It’s about the pressure on authors today to have a preexisting popular platform before publishing a book, or any creative work product for that matter. How well a book sells is determined by how well the author self-promotes. Pertinent to the circles I run in, let’s talk about tarot and witchy books.

Social media influencers have democratized culture, but perhaps have also diluted specialty creative industries. Instead of an experienced, established industry expert who is the gatekeeper of what ought to get published, the consuming public is now collectively the “gatekeeper” determining who The Algorithm will favor. Publishers are yielding to the consumer public opinion, via numbers, on who ought to be published.

Top selling books are not necessarily by the most knowledgeable virtuoso in that field but rather, are by whichever charismatic personality has the most followers on YouTube and TikTok. Therefore, to be a top selling author, you need to cater to that consuming public. It’s not about your resume, curriculum vitae, or credentials; it’s about your personal brand.

Inspired by that article, I thought I’d share my experiences on having to navigate social media, personal branding, and platform building as an author.

The more recognized naming convention for the sutra is the Guan Yinzi (闕尹子) or Wen Shi Zhen Jing (文始真經) attributed to the gatekeeper who Laozi encountered.

The Guan Yinzi (or Wen Shi Zhen Jing)

According to lore, the gatekeeper at the Western Pass, named Yinxi 尹喜, later given the name Wenshi (文始), transcribed the teachings of Laozi and that text became the Tao Te Ching (道德經). Alternate tellings have Laozi writing the teachings down into two books himself, which the gatekeeper then receives.

StaarCon has the personableness and small-group-feel of the Omega conference, some of the razzle-dazzle characteristics of the iconic Readers Studio, and the ability to attract big personalities the way NWTS does.

So if you’re looking for that tarot conference with a little bit of something for everyone, then that’s StaarCon.

Accelevents Attendee Portal StaarCon 2024

I was invited back as a keynote for StaarCon 2024, my first time attending in person (the 2021 conference during the pandemic was virtual only). What’s unique about StaarCon is its hybrid model, with the virtual event managed by Accelevents. Meaning you can elect to attend in person or attend virtually from the comfort of your own home.

For the price of admission, you’re getting access to a wide array of master classes on tarot techniques, tarot adjacent studies like astrology, crystals, and sound bath meditation, in-depth targeted explorations on how to read the cards, powerful and transformative guided visual journeying sessions for connecting with an animal totem or quantum healing, tarot business essentials, more academic-driven workshops, to creating and selling your own deck, just to name a few of the topics covered this weekend.

The Lepus Tarot by Witchy Cauldron, with illustrations by Artem Chernobai, arrived in my mailbox under somewhat mysterious circumstances. I’m not entirely sure how I came to receive it, but I sure am glad I did!

The deck’s namesake, lepus, means hares, or rabbits, and is also a reference to the constellation Lepus, eternally hunted by Orion. I love how the card back design even has constellation map vibes.

‘s Tarot de El Dios de los Tres (Tarot of the God of Three) first came out in 2021 and I’ve had my eye on it since. There’s something about it that immediately sets it apart from most tarot decks I’ve come across on the market. It feels counterculture, cheeky, and yet not without depth and substance of thought.

Major Arcana, Chariot through The World; Ace, Two, and Three of Pentacles

Navarro is an Andalusian born artist and illustrator who blends sacred imagery from world religions and pop iconography to design a universe that is energetic, joyful, and liberating.

Four through King of Pentacles; Ace through Seven of Cups

This isn’t a deck review, just a walk-through, as I have not done readings with these cards. For me personally, this is a collector’s deck. It’s a deck I’ve acquired for the artwork, to get to hold a gallery of beautiful illustrations in my hands.

Michele Knight-Waite is a celebrated, award-winning astrologer and psychic. Once voted “UK’s Favourite Psychic,” she is a media personality, best-selling author, and regular astrology columnist at various magazines. These days you can also find her on  and  where her generous spirit is on full display.

I love that she has channeled her many gifts into creating a modern RWS-based tarot deck that blends together the art of photo collage, with cameos from some of our favorite historical figures, and the familiar iconography of Pamela Colman Smith, who is featured on the High Priestess card.

There are notable graphic design elements here that I really love. Somehow, it’s both borderless and it has a border, where the full composition continues all the way to the edge, but then there is that classic tarot card white margin for the card title. See also how, for instance, in the Seven of Pentacles, the Pentacles “spill” over and out of the border.

The Gold Lyre Tarot is a feminine spin on the classic RWS, representing the divine feminine of today’s blended American culture and gender-fluid evolution. It is the exquisite creation of two best friends, Lacy Martin and Christine Scanlon, who combined their talents in art and divination to produce this tarot deck that balances the scales between modern and traditional.

The deck’s namesake is attributed to Apollo’s lyre, Apollo being the god of prophecy and music, and the lyre a symbol of wisdom and moderation. Hermes was the creator of the golden lyre. Later merged with the Egyptian god Anubis to create the syncretized Hermanubis, the namesake also calls upon the god of translators, interpretors, and conductors of souls. Likewise, the Gold Lyre Tarot holds songs and messages that only you can hear.

I first intuited what felt like a waning phase in terms of activity and creativity in the tarot industry in 2022. But, you know, maybe it was just me. So I dismissed the thought.

Oracle of the Egyptian Gods by Silvana Alasia features portraits of Egyptian deities painted in tempera on papyrus in the ancient Egyptian drying method.

It was the art style really captivated me, and then as I explored the deck further, it turns out to be of the most well-done Kemetic-themed decks I’ve seen in a while.

This is a deck of 36 cards, each bringing messages of wisdom, warnings of danger, advice, and protection. Each card features a god or goddess from the Egyptian pantheon.

By “questionable” I mean authors whose morality, political beliefs, sociopolitical affiliations, or credibility have been put under compelling scrutiny.

Perhaps more so than any other subject area of interest, when you navigate religious, spiritual, and occult spaces, you have to conscientiously assess and process where you stand on this point. While the issue of where you stand on condoning the reading or the publishing of works by questionable authors is ever present, it floated to the top of my thoughts recently with this announcement by the publishing house Inner Traditions:

To explore this case study, I recommend clicking on the above IG posting and reading the comments, because I’m not going to re-post the nutty alt-right supporters who resorted to name-calling, homophobia, misogyny, and mocking people’s pronouns. There are also a few very long and thorough comments, too long to fit in a single screenshot, so I won’t be re-posting those either, though they’re worth a read.

Challenge of the announcement with all of the above aforementioned was predictable. What kind of took me by surprise was the strength and volume of voices who were saying, “This is totally fine. Hey liberals, stop being such babies.”

I have so many meandering and tangent thoughts.

The Masonic Tarot came out in October 2022, created and illustrated by Chilean artist and academic Patricio Diaz Silva, and it is in the top 10% of the most well-done tarot decks in recent years. The illustrations for the Major Arcana are exquisite, as are the court cards.

Do note, however, that this deck has elected to go with non-narrative illustrations for the pips, which works for the Masonic Tarot given its ceremonial leaning purposes.

The deck is designed as a “gateway into the secret mysteries of the soul” integrating the sacred symbolism of Freemasonry. The premise melds together the arcana of the tarot with models from Masonic rites, with heavy emphasis on alchemy.

So I posted this video yesterday:

When I made this video, I genuinely did not think there’d be anything controversial about it. I will even continue the assumption now and say that if you actually watch it in the entirety, you, too, would not reach the conclusion that it’s trying to be anti-male. Nor will you find it laced with any ulterior motive of gender politics.

Heck, now in retrospect, I probably could have titled the video “Tao Te Ching & the Divine Feminine.” Right? It’s just that I have a complicated relationship with the concept of “divine feminine” hence I went with “feminist metaphysics.”

Within hours of its posting, I received the following comments:

I’m compounding several different topics into one video and probably should have done separate videos for each topic, but for me, they’re all related to each other, and so I guess from that personal perspective, it makes sense for me to be presenting them in one bundle.

Upfront, let’s clarify: I’m not teaching, I’m sharing. I wanted to learn more, went out and attempted to learn more, and this video and companion blog post is just me passing on to you what I’ve learned.

Dragon Gods of the Earth 土地龍神

Image Source: 香港古蹟行腳.

Dragon god(s) (土地龍神, tǔ dì lóong shén ) are personifications of the land, where mountains and rivers meet, and thus from a feng shui perspective, reveal dragon veins (龍脈, lóong mài).

Rituals (such as 化胎, Huàtāi; in Hakka, it’s pronounced Fā Tói) can be performed to harness the qi or powerful essence from these dragon veins to bless a home and bless lands that the Hakka now occupy to ensure good harvests, prosperity, safety, protection, and good health.

What’s distinct about Hakka dragon spirits veneration is its association with the earth rather than water. Traditionally in Chinese lore, dragon spirits/gods 龍神 and the Dragon King 龍王 are associated with the temperaments of the seas.

The Akashic Records is very much a Western conception, right? The Theosophists of the 19th century formulated a mash-up of Eastern and Western esoteric traditions and from that mash-up came its most popular legacy– the Akashic Records.

Most of us get that the “Akashic” part was inspired by the akasha, a fifth element or essence found in various Asian traditions, associated with the sky, space, aether, and in Buddhism, even a state of mind. But what about the “Records” part?

But first, I’d like to start with the discussion on akasha and godhead.

A co-founder of Buddhists of Color and Access to Zen, Rev. Shutt facilitates the Engaged Four Noble Truths program, a restorative framework for meeting any given critical need, especially when applied to oppressive forces and systems. In 2020, that program was called upon to help meet critical needs emerging as a result of the pandemic, and after the murder of George Floyd, to help facilitate ways Buddhist practice can address racial justice.

“This book is for all who have been hurt and harmed by the system of white supremacy and other systemic wrongs,” writes Shutt, “and for those seeking restoration and healing.”

Guan Luo Yin 觀落陰 is a practice of wu shamanism 巫術 found primarily in the South Pacific. While methodologies will differ, one approach is as an astral journey to the underworld to see the spirits of those who have passed on; another is as a method of “remote viewing.”

Some traditions conceptualize the descent as beginning from the entrance to a cave at the base of a mountain (associated with the Kunlun Mountain). Others conceptualize it as a palace with many floors descending (as opposed to ascending the way floors of a building are constructed in the physical earthly world).

This video serves as an introduction to the practice.

Refuge in the Storm is a collection of 24 essays by Buddhist chaplains, spiritual leaders, psychotherapists, medical providers, and scholars who share their perspectives on crisis counseling, be that personal or global crisis.

We begin with a poem by Mushim Ikeda, “Five Irises for Mary Oliver.” One line in particular might resonate with you:

We aren’t always reduced to our entangled thoughts, our anguish.

Praying with my friend this morning, he said Thank you, he asked Help– we bow down and rise up.

Crisis is a disruptive event or relationship. A disaster, per the definition published by the American Red Cross, is “an event of such destructive magnitude and force as to dislocate, injure, or kill people, separate family members, and damage or destroy homes.” Disasters produce a ripple effect– the numbers of people affected on a fundamentally spiritual level is far greater than the number of people killed or injured.

When faced with crisis or disaster, how do we lean in to Buddhist tenets to help us emerge from it?

The Little Sister Tarot is a tribute to the cycle of life, what we gain from that cycle, and the heartbreak of loss. It is a deck about rebirth, illustrated by an artist who descends from a legacy of artists and art professors, and paints from the rugged north coast of California.

Ginny Thonson is a little sister. She lost her big brother to leukemia and later, her big sister to a tragic accident. Their spirits accompany her always, though, and so she perpetually embodies that role of the little sister.

The RWS-based deck follows the narrative of Eden Gray’s The Fool’s Journey, though here The Fool is represented by the little sister. We follow her journey, documented through encounters with wise spirit guides and vignettes of her life experiences.

The Fool here is naive yet fearless in the face of the challenges that lie ahead in her journey. She is not motivated by materialism, but rather, is lifted by her innocence and playful nature.

I don’t have a dog in this fight, no skin in the game as they say. There is more benefit to me opting out of this conversation and staying quiet. In fact, speaking up would be ill-advised; I only stand to lose.

First, a quick statement about my personal background, as that will be context for my perspective. I am a self-taught illustrator and in the late 90s was highly skeptical of using digital art in tarot. Everything people who are against AI are saying right now about AI in tarot art was exactly my perspective of digital illustrator tools in tarot 30 years ago (because I did not understand digital art).

At the time I was alarmed to see how many digital artists could create something with the computer that looked almost too perfect, and do it so quickly, but then if you take away their tech and put a pencil in their hand, they could barely do freehand sketches.

However, my judgmental opinion was on the basis of a very superficial understanding of digital art. As I learned more about the process and was exposed to more digital artists as individuals, getting to know the intricacies of their creative process, the more my opinion evolved. I met more and more digital artists who could do phenomenal freehand sketching, and who had simply chosen digital software as their medium, not unlike deciding on acrylics, or pastels, or watercolor, or clay.

Now for the commentary on current affairs…

Yikes, did the well-known public figure in the world of tarot just say, in that above comment, that they “know of no Chinese printing” company that doesn’t steal copyrighted work? And then imply that Chinese people like to “beat the foreigner” aka exploit white people?
