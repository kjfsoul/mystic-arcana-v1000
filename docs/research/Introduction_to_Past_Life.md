Introduction to Past Life Astrology

On  By In , ,

This is an independent study course that delves into reading a birth chart for past life and karmic insights, to explore soul patterns through natal astrology.

For more than a decade I have had on my back burner of book manuscripts a multi-volume encyclopedia on astrology, where I want to cover both Western and Eastern modalities of astrology, through the Ages.

One of those volumes was or would have been on past life astrology, but then after more thinking, that particular subject isn’t something I want traditionally published as a book. It’s not something I want to become “known” for. That meant I now had hundreds of pages of astrological reference material that I didn’t know what to do with.

So I created this handbook to be packaged into an online independent study course. One recommended prerequisite: You have intermediate proficiency with Western astrology.

The first thing I want to say about astrological chart readings from a past life perspective is that it really is an art. What I mean by that is 50% and only 50% of it is technical analysis based on agreed-upon conventions of what certain placements mean thematically, and then 50% of it is what you bring to the table in terms of intuition and experience. What makes one past life astrology reading mediocre and another past life astrology reading phenomenal is artistry. Your artistry.

Which is to say that what I can provide in a handbook such as this one is only halfway to the goal. I’ve only taken you to the midpoint. To fully flesh out the full picture and profile of past life incarnations, you need to cultivate your own intuition, psychic ability, and also, hard-won experience as an astrologer. I give you tools. What you do with the tools is the difference between a Kindergarten drawing and a Michelangelo masterpiece.

Nonetheless, my objective for this course is to get you operational when it comes to doing past life astrology chart readings for yourself and for others.

My hope is that the materials I’ve provided you with represent core content that you can easily take and build out with to create and design your own approach to past life readings that integrate natal astrology.

The Handbook is a very technical, analytical, and systematic approach to interpreting astrological features through the lens of karmic principles. But that will only get you to 50% of a good past life reading. You, the astrologer, the intuitive, the spiritualist, you bring the other 50%.

The contents of this course pack is the “science” or the rote method. You have to bring the art, the artistry of astrology. That’s the reason why I characterized this course as being for intermediate astrologers.

Initially this offering was going to be the Handbook only. And then after I finished the Handbook, I worried that it might be unwieldy. What if it’s a bit overwhelming.

So then I created a Workbook template, a document to help navigate the Handbook so you can piece together your own past life astrology reading write-up.

The text in red font provides recommended reading from the Handbook for some additional study info. Then delete the sections in red.

The text in blue font provides instructions on how to fill out the Workbook. It tells you which section in the Handbook to turn to for reference, and what to copy-paste from the Handbook into the Workbook for the initial rough and rote draft of your past life astrology write-up. Then you delete the text in blue.

There are these optional sections in the Workbook for integrating tarot, if you’d like. If not, just delete those sections altogether.

At the end of the Workbook is an appendix for journaling personal reflections on your past life astrology reading. This is also optional. If it doesn’t make sense for you, simply delete.

I included an appendix section to the Workbook for journaling post-reading reflections because for me, it helps. It helps me to reconcile some of the data that initially impressed upon me as contradicting. And it helps me to connect the dots, to better piece the puzzle together, and then to connect it to the present, to understand its relevancy.

Together, the Handbook and Workbook will help you to develop an insightful astrology practice for uncovering a soul’s past patterns and karmic influences through a natal chart.

The course is designed with an intermediate astrologer in mind, to empower you with the knowledge and reference tools to interpret key chart indicators that hint at past life experiences and unresolved lessons.

I believe that studying past life astrology offers a unique lens for understanding both personal and collective karma, life purpose, and your own emotional patterns. By learning how to do a past life analysis on a birth chart, you will gain the ability to not only foster self-awareness, but also be empowered to guide others in their past life astrological explorations.

Deliverables

The Handbook. A 245-page reference manual (111,479 words) that covers the moon sign and rising sign specific (and narrowly tailored) to past life astrology, chart ruler implications in the 12 houses, sign and planetary influences in Houses 4, 8, and 12, south node in the 12 signs and in the 12 houses, plus a fairly extensive appendix on astrology basics.

The Workbook. A 36-page past life astrology reading template for aggregating the sections from the Handbook pertinent to a given birth chart, which is used in tandem with the Handbook to produce the initial draft of a past life astrology reading.
