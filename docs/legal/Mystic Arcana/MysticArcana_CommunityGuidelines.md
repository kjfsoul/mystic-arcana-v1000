**Builder’s Note**  
These guidelines establish expectations for respectful interaction across all Mystic Arcana spaces—app, website, social, and live/AI sessions.

## 3. When Sharing Your Story

You are encouraged to express your truth—but please:

- Avoid sharing content that may be triggering without warning (e.g., trauma, violence)
- Understand that Mystic Arcana is a spiritual reflection space, not a crisis service
- Be mindful of tone and audience, especially in public forums or shared spreads

## 4. Youth Safety & Sensitive Content

Mystic Arcana is open to seekers 16 and older.  
We do not tolerate grooming, inappropriate messages, or attempts to engage minors in suggestive conversations.

Flag content you believe is harmful or abusive—we review all flagged reports.

## 5. AI Reader + Human Guide Boundaries

- AI responses are programmed to reject inappropriate or abusive prompts
- Human guides/readers may end sessions if disrespected or endangered
- Sessions may be monitored for abuse patterns (with anonymity preserved)

## 6. Enforcement & Reporting

Violating these guidelines may result in:

- Content removal
- Warning

Repeat offenders or those committing serious harm will be removed permanently and may be reported to proper authorities.

## 7. Community Uplift Prompts

To set the tone across your platform, use light message cues like:

> "The cards are sacred—so is your voice. Speak with care."  
> "Growth happens in safe space. Keep the circle clear."  
> "We grow through curiosity, not cruelty."  
> "Bring your energy, not your ego."
