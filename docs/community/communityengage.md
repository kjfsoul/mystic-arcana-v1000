Design a system where community engagement—such as feedback, sharing, and participation in group readings—unlocks new reader personas (e.g., animals, planets), custom visual themes, and advanced spread layouts. Integrate gamified elements like badges, progress tracking, and community events that influence persona evolution and introduce new interpretive styles. Provide dashboards for users to track their journey, saved spreads, and community milestones.
